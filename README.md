# ELISA_Optimization
These Codes were used to optimize the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) data.

Our curve is calculated on a third degree polynomial and we want to get a satisfactory R score without loosing too
many data points. This can all be done by hand, however that takes time and energy away from other more pressing
data analysis. The code here helps streamline data quality control and final output.
